## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my Github Portfolio! You can find additional information about me below...

- 👨‍🎓 I recently completed a 6-month immersive AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp through Caltech (powered by Fullstack Academy). This program utilized active learning to gain proficiency in data technologies and programming tools including Python, Keras, and Tensorflow, and understanding of machine learning, deep learning, and data science processes.
- 🔭 I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities related to AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning. 
- 🛠 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that continue to expand my machine learning and deep learning skills, along with projects that challenge and grow my skill set. My mindset is very growth-oriented and I believe the only way for true growth is through challenge and discomfort.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about ultra running! I ran 1,104 miles around Lake Michigan in 36 days (~31 miles a day) while raising $70,000 for the Alzheimer's Association. I've also completed many ultra trail races, with my longest being a point-to-point race in Arizona covering 101.5 miles and 18,000 ft of elevation gain.
